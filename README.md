# PI-approx
Graphical program (Java) to approximate the PI using various mathematical methods

Graphical Java program to approximate the PI using Bellard or Chebyshev methods. 
The code is written using the Object Oriented Java and Java Swing. 
I Recommend NetBeans 11.1, which I used during the development. 
Enjoy! I hope you'll find the code well-written and the program interesting! 

If you need help or you only want to know something more about me or the code, contact me!
